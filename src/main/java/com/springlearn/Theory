APPLICATION CONTEXT

        ApplicationContext and IoC container are closely related.

        AppContext is a type of IoC container.

        It extends the BeanFactory interface.

        It is an interface itself, therefore it can be implemented by its implementations.

        Its implementations are as follows:
             1. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
             2. FileSystemXmlApplicationContext
             3. AnnotationConfigApplicationContext


        ApplicationContext is a key component responsible for managing beans, providing features
        such as dependency injection,
                lifecycle management of beans,
                event propagation,
                internationalization, and others

DEPENDENCY INJECTION

Dependency injection is a programming technique in which an object or function receives
other objects or functions that it requires, as opposed to creating them internally.

It is of two types

    SETTER INJECTION

    Setter injection is also known as property injection
    - Can be done with p schema

    CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION

    <constructor-args> tag can be used

    The number of <constructor-args> must be same as the args of constructor



Constructor args can also be passed via c:schema

Argument sequence is not important when using c schema but important when using constructor-arg tag if "index" attrib is not used

The default type used by Spring to set values is string

When two constructors with same number of arguments but different types
 - If the they string then string constructor will be called
 - Otherwise whichever is first
